gpx2map
=======

Put GPX track on Google Map or OpenStreetMap


For details have a look at the Homepage

https://pages.github.io/sd2k9/gpx2map/

Development is ongoing on the master branch,
just fetch the latest version from here.

If you prefer having a version number or download an archive file,
have a look at the releases page under  https://github.com/sd2k9/gpx2map/releases/

It could be out of date, so I suggest following the master branch instead.
